    - (__stack_chk_fail)
  - Fixed make check
  - Hardcoded stage2 start address in stage1.S
  - Added new VESA3 support (new commands vbeset, vbeprobe, vbematch)

/* TrustedGRUB v1.1.3 */

  - Support for Linux versions 2.6.23 and above
  - Improved Checkfile-output

/* TrustedGRUB v1.1.2 */

  - GCC-4 compilation support

/* TrustedGRUB v1.1.0 */

  - fixed the measurement-process of arbitrary kernels (e.g., XEN)
  - fixed some output, when "-DSHOW_SHA1" is set
  - fixed some minors and added some options in the "build_TrustedGRUB"-script

/* TrustedGRUB v1.0.1 */

  - added cmdline-measurement into PCR12
  - fixed PCR-update for stage2_eltorito-images
  - added GCC-version verification in build_TrustedGRUB.sh

/* TrustedGRUB v1.0-rc5-ntfs */

  - added NTFS-read patch

/* TrustedGRUB v1.0-rc5 */

  - corrected PCR-update mechanism for TPM 1.2 BIOS implementations
  - "savedefault": excluded from measurement
  - beauty corrections

/* TrustedGRUB v1.0-rc4 */

  - Updated to latest GRUB Release 0.9.7
  - Including password dialog support
  - Including patches for running L4 microkernels (e.g., L4 fiasco)
  - New Software-SHA1-implementation
  - Improved checkfile option with software measurements
  - TPM Support with TPM detection
  - TPM hashing improvements
  - New "sha1"-commandline utility
  - New "verify_pcr" utility to verify the correctness of Trusted GRUB
  - New "create_sha1" utility

/* TrustedGRUB v0.8.1 */

  - corrected some minor (not security critical) bugs in the TrustedGRUB
    enhancements. Thanks to Marko Wolf for recognizing them in the source 
    code
  - the comments within TrustedGRUB's source code have been extended, especially
    in the load_checkfile function
  - the file README.TrustedGRUB has been slightly modified
  - corrected a bug in (original) GRUB which could lead to problems during
    compilation (wrong data type within the file fsys_reiserfs.c)


/* TrustedGRUB v0.8 */

  - TrustedGRUB's measurement unit has been completely redisgned. Instead of loading
    components (as the kernel) twice, it is now loaded only once, thus
    preventing a race condition which could be used for attack purposes.
    Thanks to Bernhard Kauer for presenting us the security leak which was
    present in previous version.
  - in order to reach the security improvements described above, 2 new
    functions (TrustedGRUB_open and TrustedGRUB_read) have been added to the file 
    disk_io.c


/* TrustedGRUB v0.7.1 */

  - TrustedGRUB now uses different PCRs (10 and 11) for storing hash values of
    operating system components (as, e.g., kernel, modules) and hash values
    of the check file and the files listed in it
  - added a file BUGS.TrustedGRUB


/* TrustedGRUB v0.7 */

  - instead of transferring single bytes to the TCG chip, TrustedGRUB is now able to
    uses larger areas of memory instead (more efficient)
  - MD5 hash algorithm not necessary any more; everything is hashed via the
    TCG extension
  - for easy creation of reference hash values, a program named create_sha1 has
    been added


/* TrustedGRUB v0.6 */

  - TrustedGRUB now able to check integrity of arbitrary files
  - integrity of commands now guaranteed
  - changes for TCG segment: is now 0x8000 (i.e., address 0x80000) for all
    components
  - patches included for easily transforming an original GRUB into TrustedGRUB

	
/* TrustedGRUB v0.5 */

  - fixed major bug in file asm.S (values have not been correctly measured)
  - minimal corrections in README file
	

/* TrustedGRUB v0.4.1 */

  - corrected some minor bug within file stage1.S	
  - README file updated
  - renamed HISTORY to ChangeLog (this file)
	

/* TrustedGRUB v0.4 */

  - binary versions included (both for hard and floppy drives)
  - original source code of stage1 included again (as commentary)
  - README file updated
  - HISTORY file added


/* TrustedGRUB v0.3 */

  - hard drive support added
  - README file updated


/* TrustedGRUB v0.2.1 */

  - initrd (initial ramdisk) is now also measured


/* TrustedGRUB v0.2 */

  - start.S now dynamically computes size of the rest of stage2 instead of
    using a fixed value


/* TrustedGRUB v0.1 */

  - initial version
  - full functionality (chain of trust is complete) 
  - supports floppy disks
